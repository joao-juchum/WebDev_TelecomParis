# LAB 1 - JavaScript basics
The purpose of this lab is to study the concepts discussed during INF203 on Web technologies and in particular JavaScript. The goal of this lab is to program in JavaScript without using the browser. Another lab session will concern JavaScript in the browsers.

## Exercise 1 - Numbers, loops, arrays, functions and recursion
**Question 1a:** Write a function named fibonaIt which calculates the nth number of the Fibonacci sequence iteratively (with a for-loop or while). fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1, fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

**Question 1b:** Write a function named fiboRec which calculates the Fibonacci sequence recursively.

**Question 1c:** Write a function fiboArr that takes an array of numbers and returns the array of results of fiboRec called on the numbers without using the JS function map. You may reuse functions from previous questions.

**Question 1d:** Write a function named fibonaMap equivalent to the function from Question 1c using the JS function map.

### To use
